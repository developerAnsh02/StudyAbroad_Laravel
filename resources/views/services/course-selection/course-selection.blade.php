            <h2 class="service-title">Cost, Time, & Accreditation</h2>
            <p class="service-text">
                Consider tuition fees, study materials, and living expenses. Look for scholarships or financial aid options. 
                Ensure the course is accredited, as recognized qualifications increase job prospects.

                different approaches. Short-term programs are ideal for quick skill acquisition, while long-term degrees 
                offer deeper expertise and stability.
